## Questions

If you have questions about implementation details, help or support, then please use our dedicated community forum at [Github Discussions](https://github.com/phil-schmidtke/easy-dapp/discussions) **PLEASE NOTE:** If you choose to instead open an issue for your question, your issue will be immediately closed and redirected to the forum.

## Reporting Issues

If you have found what you think is a bug, please [file an issue](https://github.com/phil-schmidtke/easy-dapp/issues/new). **PLEASE NOTE:** Issues that are identified as implementation questions or non-issues will be immediately closed and redirected to [Github Discussions](https://github.com/phil-schmidtke/easy-dapp/discussions)

## Suggesting new features

If you are here to suggest a feature, first create an issue if it does not already exist. From there, we will discuss use-cases for the feature and then finally discuss how it could be implemented.
